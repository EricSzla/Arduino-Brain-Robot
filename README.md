# Section 1: Hardware
**Arduino board (Arduino UNO ATMEGA328P R3 € 26.98**)   
- A small programmable computer which acts as the head of the robot, allowing us to control its behaviours.

**Distance sensor (HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor € 4.49**)
- A sensor which measures the distance from the nearest objects by sending and recieving waves. This sensor allows us to program the robot to take appropriate action if there is an obstacle within the range.

**AWG Jumper Wires (HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor € 4.95**)
- Wires are used to connect different components together.

**Battery holder (€ 1.29**)
- Robots, like humans need energy in order to operate, they consume their energy from batteries. Battery box allow as to connect the batteries to the device.

**Prototyping board (€ 5.95**)
- Prototyping board plays an unique part in planning stage.

**Motor controller (Arduino Motor Shield R3 € 44.00**)
- Controller which allows us to control the motors of the vehicle kit, neceserry in order to program/controll the speed and turnings of the robot.

**Vehicle kit (Magician Chassis € 44.00**)
- The base for the robot, which includes motors and wheels, supports the rest of hardware, compiled together forms a fully operational robot.
